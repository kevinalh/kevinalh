## Hi there

I'm Kevin, Data Engineering lead based in Lima, Peru. Here's a few facts about me:

### Tech

I'm familiar with AWS as a cloud platform, Kafka as data transport and Airflow for orchestration. My favorite
databases are Postgres, Snowflake and DuckDB.

Every once in a while active on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2616577/) and the other Stack
Exchange network sites.

### Music

I'm passionate about music, tracking the music I listen to everyday since 2014 on my [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/kevinalh)
account. Main genres I listen to are shoegaze, punk and whatever-is-in-a-top-500-list-core.

I also play a Fender Jazzmaster guitar and a Fender Jazz bass on a regular basis.

### Academics

I have a Bachelors in Mathematics from the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, with a exchange semester in the University of
Oklahoma.

I've also taken PhD-level classes in the Summer Program of the Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics (IMPA) in
Rio de Janeiro, focusing in Probability Theory.
