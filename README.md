## Hi there

I'm Kevin, a Distributed Systems Engineer based in London. Originally from Peru.

### Tech

I'm familiar with AWS and GCP as cloud platforms, Kafka as data transport, and Airflow for orchestration.
My favorite databases are Postgres, Snowflake, DuckDB, and ClickHouse.

Every once in a while active on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2616577/) and the other Stack
Exchange network sites.

### Music

I'm passionate about music, tracking the music I listen to daily since 2014 on my [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/kevinalh)
account. The main genres I listen to are shoegaze, punk, and whatever-is-in-a-top-500-list-core.

I also play a Fender Jazzmaster guitar and a Fender Jazz bass regularly.

### Academics

I have a bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, with an exchange semester at the University of
Oklahoma.

I've also taken PhD-level classes in the Summer Program of the Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics (IMPA) in
Rio de Janeiro, focusing on Probability Theory.
